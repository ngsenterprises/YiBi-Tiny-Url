# YiBi-Tiny-Url
Shrink a url 

Still in the process of implementing the data base to 
provide the functionality of determing if a smll url already exists, storing the 
Int seed etc.  I used Cassandra just because I know I will be using it later. Good practice.

Used Akka Http and the patterm matching syntax for the routing.
I used a bijective function to create a tiny unique url extension.  


Fun project. Will finish soon.
